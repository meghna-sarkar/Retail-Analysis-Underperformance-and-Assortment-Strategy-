###  Methodology & Execution

Data Modeling & Simulation (Power Query/M Language): Power Query is used to cleanse, model, and apply M language conditional logic to enforce business rules, accurately simulating the Male Category underperformance scenario.

Performance Diagnostics (SQL): Complex SQL queries (JOINs, GROUP BY) calculate key efficiency metrics like AOV and Basket Size, isolating specific low-performing store/category combinations.

Strategic Delivery (Tableau): SQL output is loaded into a Tableau dashboard to visualize findings and deliver data-backed strategies for assortment correction and marketing reallocation.
